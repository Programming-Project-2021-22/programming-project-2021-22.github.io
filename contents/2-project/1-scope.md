In this course, you will work on an open-ended project. This means that you are free to choose what application you will develop using Java.

## What you can do

You can build a **management information system**, implemented as a desktop app, a command-line app, or a web app.

Although Java is not the most popular language for games, you can build a **game** as your course project. After all, [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft#:~:text=in%20the%20Java%20programming%20language.) was built in Java and so were [these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Java_platform_games) other games!

You may even want to learn an open-source game frameworks, like [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) and [jMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/).

You can also build a **library** for other programmers to use when they create their own applications. For inspiration, you can check out popular Java libraries like [Google Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) and [Apache HTTPComponents](https://hc.apache.org/).

Another good idea is a **data science** project, in which you create graphics and perform statistical analyses to discover interesting insights from a dataset.

If you are into testing, a **browser automation** project might be right for you. In such a project you will program interactions with websites or web applications adn test if they behave as expected. To do that, you will likely need to learn something like the [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/). 

If none of these ideas sounds interesting, you could do a **web crawling** project. In this case, your goal would be to automate the collection of data from one or more websites and showcase this data in an interesting way!

But as I said before, this is an open project. If you do not like any of the these ideas, feel free to explore your own and let your creativity flow!

## What you cannot do

You **CANNOT** develop a mobile app.

You **CANNOT** use a database management system, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

Your project **CANNOT** require the installation of a server to be deployed, such as [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/). If you are developing a web application, make sure you embed your server in your jar. If you are developing a Spring Boot application you may want to check [this](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.7.RELEASE/reference/html/howto-build.html) or [this](https://www.baeldung.com/deployable-fat-jar-spring-boot) guide.

You **CANNOT** copy and paste a project from the web and call it a day. It is fine, however, to use projects as inspiration. If you reuse any code, make sure that you reference the source explicitly in your documentation.

You **CANNOT** use other programming languages besides Java, including Kotlin, Groovy, Closure, and Scala.
