## Groups

This is a group project, in which self-organized groups can have up to 3 members.

We strongly discourage you from working on this project by yourself, as collaborating with other developers is part of the learning experience we designed for this course. If, however, you really want to work on a project on your own or could no find suitable partners, 1-person groups are accepted. 

We encourage you to evenly split responsibilities for this project, including design, coding, testing, and documentation.

## Delivering your project

Your project must be delivered via Git. 

**Click [here]() to accept the corresponding Github Classroom assignment and automatically create your repository.**

Remember that only the code on your default branch will be evaluated (usually called `main` or `master`).

And please do not send us your source code via email or Teams!

## Peer-review process

You will evaluate each other's projects following the guidelines describe [here]().

Each student will evaluate up to 3 other projects and each project will be evaluated by up to 3 students.

Reviews should be posted as issues on the Github repository of the reviewed project.

## Grading

Your **project is worth 60% of your final grade** for this course. 18 out of 30 points.

Your project grade will be given by the lecturers, but it will be based on:
  - your peers' reviews, and
  - our own review

Note that **everybody in a group will get the same grade**.

Another **30% of your final grade** (9 out of 30 points) will comes from an **oral examination**. In it, you will briefly present and demo your project, and answer questions about your project and the techniques you used. So, make sure that you know how your whole application works!
