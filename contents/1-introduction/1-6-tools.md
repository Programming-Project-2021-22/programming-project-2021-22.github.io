To work on your exercises and your project, you will need the following software.

## Java

We will use [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-17-2021-09-14/) in this course, the latest long-term support release of the language.

You don't have it installed yet, now is the time!

## IDE: Integrated development environment

We will NOT force you to use a particular IDE in this course.

Instead, I would like you to:

1. Try out different IDEs
1. Choose your favorite one
1. Tell me why! I'll ask some of you about it in our next class

Here are some popular options:

1. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
1. [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/kepler/sr1/eclipse-ide-java-developers)
1. [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/)

You can find many reviews and comparisons online, such as:

   By Adam Mudianto at Techgalery.com

You are free to choose the IDE you enjoy coding on the most!

We will use Maven to install dependencies, build, package, and run your assignments and projects, so there is no need to worry about your IDE choice.

## Git

In this course, we will use [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a free and open source distributed version control system.
