## Attendance

We recognize that people learn in different ways, so attendance in this course is not mandatory, but it is *strongly recommended*.

Remember that you cannot use office hours for the classes you missed!

## I have a question!

If you cannot solve a programming problem, what should you do?

1. Google it! s
2. Check the course material and the [recommended books and videos](/introduction/bibliography).
3. Ask your colleagues.
4. Ask the student tutor.
5. Ask the lecturers.

> Remember that **being able learn and solve problems by yourself** is a fundamental skill if you want to work as a developer. 
>
> There is always a new library or new programming language we will need to use!

## Communication etiquette

If you want to communicate with the lecturers via email, remember to tell us:

- Who you are: your name, student id, and the course you are attending
- What issue/challenging you are facing
- If the issue is code related, please commit your code to a Git repository and share it with us
- What you have done to address it so far
- What do you expect from us
  
Here is a **GOOD** example:

> Subject: Issue with Java Collections
> 
> Dear Prof. X,
> 
> I am Y, a first year BSc student attending the Programming Project course (student ID 123456789).
> 
> While doing the home assignment on Java Collections, I came across an issue I was unable to solve. When loading the data file and applying the AAA method, the java compiler yields the error "BBB".
> 
> I tried doing CCC and DDD, always with the same outcome. I searched on Google and Stack Overflow but couldn't find an appropriate solution.
> 
> I would appreciate if we could schedule a meeting during office hours to discuss the issue.
> 
> Thank you in advance.
>
> Kind regards,  
> John Doe

And here is a **BAD** example:

> Subject: collections
>
> hi, i can't use arraylist correctly.
