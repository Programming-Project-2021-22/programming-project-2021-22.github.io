Here is an answer from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-much-Java-do-you-need-to-know-to-get-a-job):

> I work with a lot of interns who have learned Java in school and are now applying it for job purposes. My answer is going to assume you're looking at entry-level positions.
>
> Schools, for the most part, do not teach Java job skills. If you're learning event driven programming using Swing, for example, expecting to use that on the job is a pipe dream. Unless you're applying to a job that lists it specifically, **most Java is web or enterprise oriented.**
>
> Conceptually, you need to understand the following in Java and know how to describe and apply it:
>
> - Understanding of all basic Java control structures, able to declare methods and a working understanding of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.
> - A understanding of classes vs. interfaces.
> - Understand the role of the public/private/protected modifiers.
> - Understanding of Strings as immutable objects. How to create mutable Strings via StringBuilder and other classes.
> - Creation of a basic Java POJO/bean (data entity).
> - Understand how statics work.
> - Know how to declare constants.
> - Understand basic class, variable and constant naming conventions.
> - Know how to organize code into packages.
> - Understand the role and usage of JAR library files and how to reference them in your application.
> - Have a working understanding of the core Java API and where to find stuff. At a minimum, know the roles and uses of classes in java.lang, understand and able to use the Java Collections API correctly (i.e. declare variables of List type, not `ArrayList`) and know some of the utility classes in `java.util`, `java.text` and `java.math`.
> - Knowledge and theory of some basic design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Facade, DAO, MVC).
> - Know what the CLASSPATH is!
> - Know how the `main()` method works and how to pass arguments to basic programs.
>
> If you're looking to get into web or enterprise development, some exposure and knowledge of the following is helpful:
>
> - Familiarity with SQL databases and programming against them via JDBC.
> - For web, understand how the HTTP protocol works and how basic web interaction takes place.
> - A basic knowledge of HTML. Specifically, basic page structure and how HTML forms work. Difference between GET and POST.
> - Any knowledge of the Servlet/JSP API, how web containers work and the Servlet lifecycle.
> - Any understanding of XML. Web services and WSDL theory is a bonus.
> - Any understanding of TCP/IP networking (TCP vs UDP, role of IP, DNS, network addressing).
> - Use of any logging framework.
> - Know what Apache Commons is!
> - Any understanding or exposure to source code control systems and why they are important.
> - Any understanding of software project management and the software development lifecycle.
>
> Notice I have not listed a single framework! I am always looking for **fundamental knowledge** and a foundation to built upon. An entry-level person is not expected to know too much. The more the better but it must be a place we can grow you from.
>
> And of that first list, only about 1/4 to 1/2 of it is ever touched upon in a college or university class. Virtually none of the second list is ever covered in college or university classes.
>
> Honestly, having a working if imperfect knowledge of stuff on the first list, able to answer some questions off the top of your head without needing a book or the Internet as a crutch at every stage and a willingness to learn is what is needed to get you in the door. Given I am usually interviewing candidates that are from the same school, I am looking for things that differentiate them.
>
> _Self-starters and motivated learners_ are often that differentiator.
