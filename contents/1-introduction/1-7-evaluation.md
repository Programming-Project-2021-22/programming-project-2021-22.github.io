## Evaluation components

- **Lab exercises**: up to 10 points
- **Group project**: up to 60 points
- **Oral exam**: up to 30 points

Your final grade will be equal to `(Assignments + Project + Oral Exam) * 0,3`

Here is an example:

- You delivered all your assignments correctly, so you got a `10/10`
- Your group delivered a good project with some flaws, so you got a `50/60`
- You answered only half of your oral exam questions appropriately, so you got a `15/30`

Your final grade would be: `(10 + 50 + 15) * 0,3 = 75 * 0,3 = 22,5`

## Lab exercises

- **Goal:** To help you assimilate the theoretical concepts taught in class
- **Points:** 10
- **Grading:** Automatically, via a Github Action.  
   You will know your lab grade as soon as you push your solutions.
- Delivery: Git (when applicable)
- There will be around **10 graded labs**
- We will discuss the solutions of some exercises after their delivery
- These exercises are individual, but we encourage you to help each other out.  
  However, **you cannot simply copy your colleague's exercise.**

## Group project

- **Goal:** To simulate a real life scenario and to help you learn by doing
- **Points:** 60
- **Grading:** Review by peers and by lecturers
- Grades are awarded to the group, not to each member individually
- Groups of up to **3 students**
- Remember that **plagiarism** means automatic failure for all of those involved.
  Trust us, we will find out.
- Projects are to be delivered through Git

## Oral exam

- **Points:** 30
- **Goal:** To evaluate your individual performance in the group project and how well you learned the theoretical concepts taught in class.
- **Grading:** Grades in the oral exam are awarded **individually**
- The oral exam will be an **interview** about your group project, in which we may ask you to:
  - Review coding decisions you made in your project
  - Explain the architecture of your project
  - Describe the behavior of a particular component or function
  - Explain programming techniques and evaluate their usage in your project
  - Discuss any other project-related topic

> You will only be able to enroll in the oral exam if `Assignments + Project >= 30`
