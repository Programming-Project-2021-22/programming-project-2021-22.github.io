## How to install Git

1. Open your terminal and type:
   ```command-line
   $ git --version
   ```
2. If you see an output with your Git version like the one below, you are good to go.
   ```command-line
   git version 2.24.3 (Apple Git-128)
   ```
3. Otherwise, access [this](https://git-scm.com/download) page
4. Choose your operating system
5. Follow the installation instructions

## Git clients

We will use Git intensively throughout this course, so you may want to install a Git client.

Here are some Git client options for you to consider:

1. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
   - Multi-platform
   - Free to use
1. [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
   - Multi-platform
   - Free version available for public repos only
   - Pro version available in the GitHub Student Developer Pack
1. [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
   - For macOS and Windows
   - Free to use

You may also use your IDE's embedded git client

1. [Git in IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/guide/tutorials/creating-a-project-from-github/clone-from-github/)
1. [Git in Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-github-visual-studio-code/)
1. [Git in Eclipse](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html)

If you are more of a "hardcore developer", don't worry, you can use Git exclusively through the command line interface!

## Git services

To collaborate and safely backup your repositories, you need a Git repository hosting service:

- [GitHub](http://github.com/):
  - Github provides a [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- [GitLab](http://gitlab.com/):
- [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/):

Note that UNIBZ offers a [self-hosted Gitlab](https://gitlab.inf.unibz.it/) service.
