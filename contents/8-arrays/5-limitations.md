Although arrays are very efficient lightweight data types, they have several limitations we should be aware of:

1. They can hold only single-type objects
2. They have fixed length
3. They offer us limited functionality
    - set-at-index, 
    - get-at-index and 
    - length

In many cases, we need more sophisticated data structures to help us solve our programming problems, such as:
- Arrays that can grow and shrink dynamically
- Queues
- Stacks
- Sets
- Maps
- Trees
- Graphs

For those, we can rely on the Java Collections API, which we will see in the following module.
