## Design Pattern Seminars

Let's flip the classroom!

1. Assemble your project group.
2. Prepare a short seminar about a design pattern:
    - *Problem*: describes when to apply the pattern 
    - *Solution*: the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations
    - *Consequences*: the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern
    - *Demo*: a small application that demonstrates the pattern

You will have 12 minutes to presentation your pattern.

**This counts as a graded lab!**
