## What is a design pattern?

"Each pattern describes a **problem** which **occurs over and over again** in our environment, and then describes the **core of the solution** to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice"

Alexander et al. [A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction](https://ubz-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/pok0fm/39UBZ_ALMA_DS21106684230001241). Oxford University Press, 1977

## What is a design pattern?

**"A design pattern is a solution to a problem in a context"**

## Why design patterns?

1. They are proven solutions for problems we recurrently encounter.
2. They are formalized **best practices**
3. They help us to save time when thinking about possible solutions for a problem
4. They help us to increase the reusability and maintainability of our code
5. They contribute to bridge the quality gap in software design by experience and novice developers

## How are design patterns described?

A design pattern has four essential elements:
- **Name**: a brief handle we can use to describe a design problem, its solutions, and consequences
   - It lets us design at a higher level of abstraction
   - It makes it easier to think about designs and to communicate them and their trade-offs to others
- **Problem**: describes when to apply the pattern 
   - It explains the problem and its context
   - It might describe specific design problems or symptoms
- **Solution**: the elements that make up the design, their relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations
   - Not a particular concrete design or implementation
   - A general arrangement of classes and objects to solve the problem
- **Consequences**: the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern
   - Helps us understanding the costs and benefits of applying the pattern
   - Critical for evaluating and comparing design alternatives
