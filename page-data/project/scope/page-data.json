After all, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft#:~:text=in%20the%20Java%20programming%20language.\">Minecraft</a> was built in Java and so were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Java_platform_games\">these</a> other games!</p>\n<p>You may even want to learn an open-source game frameworks, like <a href=\"https://libgdx.com/\">libGDX</a> and <a href=\"https://jmonkeyengine.org/\">jMonkeyEngine</a>.</p>\n<p>In past editions of this course, students created:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A multiplayer pictionary game.</li>\n<li>A game to help people improve their typing speed.</li>\n<li>An idle game about collecting resources playable through Telegram.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also build a <strong>library</strong> for other programmers to use when they create their own applications. For inspiration, you can check out popular Java libraries like <a href=\"https://github.com/google/guava\">Google Guava</a> and <a href=\"https://hc.apache.org/\">Apache HTTPComponents</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In previous years, a group developed a Linear Algebra Library.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another good idea is a <strong>data science</strong> project, in which you create graphics and perform statistical analyses to discover interesting insights from a dataset.</p>\n<p>If you are into testing, a <strong>browser automation</strong> project might be right for you. In such a project you will program interactions with websites or web applications adn test if they behave as expected. To do that, you will likely need to learn something like the <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\n<p>If none of these ideas sounds interesting, you could do a <strong>web crawling</strong> project. In this case, your goal would be to automate the collection of data from one or more websites and showcase this data in an interesting way!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Last year, a group implemented an crawler to get NBA stats from websites and then exposed it via a web API.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But as I said before, this is an open project. If you do not like any of the these ideas, feel free to explore your own and let your creativity flow!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-you-cannot-do\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-you-cannot-do\" aria-label=\"what you cannot do permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What you cannot do</h2>\n<p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> develop a mobile app.</p>\n<p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> use a database management system, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.</p>\n<p>Your project <strong>CANNOT</strong> require the installation of a server to be deployed, such as <a href=\"https://tomcat.apache.org/\">Apache Tomcat</a>. If you are developing a web application, make sure you embed your server in your jar. If you are developing a Spring Boot application you may want to check <a href=\"https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.2.7.RELEASE/reference/html/howto-build.html\">this</a> or <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/deployable-fat-jar-spring-boot\">this</a> guide.</p>\n<p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> copy and paste a project from the web and call it a day. It is fine, however, to use projects as inspiration. If you reuse any code, make sure that you reference the source explicitly in your documentation.</p>\n<p>You <strong>CANNOT</strong> use other programming languages besides Java, including Kotlin, Groovy, Closure, and Scala.</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/project/scope","title":"Scope","course":"Programming Project 2021/22","previous":"/introduction/agreements","next":"/project/rules","chapter":2,"section":1,"module":"Course Project","banner":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/project/scope"}},
