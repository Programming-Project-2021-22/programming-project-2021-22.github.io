My answer is going to assume you're looking at entry-level positions.</p>\n<p>Schools, for the most part, do not teach Java job skills. If you're learning event driven programming using Swing, for example, expecting to use that on the job is a pipe dream. Unless you're applying to a job that lists it specifically, <strong>most Java is web or enterprise oriented.</strong></p>\n<p>Conceptually, you need to understand the following in Java and know how to describe and apply it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding of all basic Java control structures, able to declare methods and a working understanding of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference.</li>\n<li>A understanding of classes vs. interfaces.</li>\n<li>Understand the role of the public/private/protected modifiers.</li>\n<li>Understanding of Strings as immutable objects. How to create mutable Strings via StringBuilder and other classes.</li>\n<li>Creation of a basic Java POJO/bean (data entity).</li>\n<li>Understand how statics work.</li>\n<li>Know how to declare constants.</li>\n<li>Understand basic class, variable and constant naming conventions.</li>\n<li>Know how to organize code into packages.</li>\n<li>Understand the role and usage of JAR library files and how to reference them in your application.</li>\n<li>Have a working understanding of the core Java API and where to find stuff. At a minimum, know the roles and uses of classes in java.lang, understand and able to use the Java Collections API correctly (i.e. declare variables of List type, not <code class=\"language-text\">ArrayList</code>) and know some of the utility classes in <code class=\"language-text\">java.util</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">java.text</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">java.math</code>.</li>\n<li>Knowledge and theory of some basic design patterns (Singleton, Factory, Facade, DAO, MVC).</li>\n<li>Know what the CLASSPATH is!</li>\n<li>Know how the <code class=\"language-text\">main()</code> method works and how to pass arguments to basic programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're looking to get into web or enterprise development, some exposure and knowledge of the following is helpful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Familiarity with SQL databases and programming against them via JDBC.</li>\n<li>For web, understand how the HTTP protocol works and how basic web interaction takes place.</li>\n<li>A basic knowledge of HTML. Specifically, basic page structure and how HTML forms work. Difference between GET and POST.</li>\n<li>Any knowledge of the Servlet/JSP API, how web containers work and the Servlet lifecycle.</li>\n<li>Any understanding of XML. Web services and WSDL theory is a bonus.</li>\n<li>Any understanding of TCP/IP networking (TCP vs UDP, role of IP, DNS, network addressing).</li>\n<li>Use of any logging framework.</li>\n<li>Know what Apache Commons is!</li>\n<li>Any understanding or exposure to source code control systems and why they are important.</li>\n<li>Any understanding of software project management and the software development lifecycle.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notice I have not listed a single framework! I am always looking for <strong>fundamental knowledge</strong> and a foundation to built upon. An entry-level person is not expected to know too much. The more the better but it must be a place we can grow you from.</p>\n<p>And of that first list, only about 1/4 to 1/2 of it is ever touched upon in a college or university class. Virtually none of the second list is ever covered in college or university classes.</p>\n<p>Honestly, having a working if imperfect knowledge of stuff on the first list, able to answer some questions off the top of your head without needing a book or the Internet as a crutch at every stage and a willingness to learn is what is needed to get you in the door. Given I am usually interviewing candidates that are from the same school, I am looking for things that differentiate them.</p>\n<p><em>Self-starters and motivated learners</em> are often that differentiator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Quora_logo_2015.svg/1200px-Quora_logo_2015.svg.png\" class=\"gatsby-img-attributes\" style=\"max-width: 300px;\" alt=\"Quora\" title=\"\"/></p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/introduction/goals","title":"Learning Goals","course":"Programming Project 2021/22","previous":"/introduction/structure","next":"/introduction/lecturers","chapter":1,"section":2,"module":"Introduction","banner":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/introduction/goals"}},
